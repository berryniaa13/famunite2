# **FAMUnite**

## 🚀 About the Project
At Florida A&M University (FAMU), students often struggle to stay updated with campus clubs, organizations, and university partner events. Information is scattered across social media, iStrike, and email, making tracking and staying current challenging.

**FAMUnite** aims to address this issue by providing a centralized, user-friendly application that keeps students informed. The app will enable students to:
- View upcoming events
- Register for events
- Save events for later
- Manage event request system

## 🛠️ Features
- 📅 **Event Calendar**: View all upcoming campus events in one place.
- 🔔 **Announcements**: Receive announcements for registered or saved events.
- 📌 **Event Registration**: Easily register for events with a single click.
- 💾 **Save Events**: Bookmark events to view later.
