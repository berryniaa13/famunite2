# **FAMUnite**

## 🚀 About the Project
At Florida A&M University (FAMU), students often struggle to stay updated with campus clubs, organizations, and university partner events. Information is scattered across social media, iStrike, and email, making tracking and staying current challenging.

- View upcoming events
- Register for events
- Save events for later
- Receive event reminders

By integrating event data from multiple sources like Instagram and iStrike, **FAMUnite** offers a unified and straightforward platform for staying engaged with campus activities.
